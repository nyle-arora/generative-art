This assignment got the data from the Bollywood.js dataset provided by Professor Compton. In this data visaualization, users can sift through a list of Bollywood movies and they can interact with the data by filtering the list through genre. 

Through this parsing and visualizing this dataset, I expected to learn more about the genres and Bollywood and seing 
which ones were the most prominent. I was a little surprised to see that less than 10% of the movies were classified
as musicals, considering every Bollywood movie I've seen has a musical number. Seeing drama, comedy, and romance as the three most popular categories did make sense though since most formulaic Bollywood movies have elements of those
three genres.
