Starter code came from Professor Compton. Inspiration for the COVID-themed argument also came from a comment Professor Compton made in class. 

This essay argues that people need to wear masks and get vaccinated to make sure that they don't get COVID. I think the argument for masks came across well in the first simulation, since masked emojis did not get COVID. The second simulation did show that masks were not a long-term solution however and a stronger version of COVID could get everyone sick. The argument for vaccines came across well in the third simulation, which showed herd immunity that kept everyone safe and eventually, the sick emojis felt better.
