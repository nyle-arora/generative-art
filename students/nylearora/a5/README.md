This is a chatbot version of the Omnitrix from the Ben 10 cartoon (arguably one of the greatest TV shows of the last billion years). If you enter in any of the pre-defined chips, the Omnitrix will turn you into that alien (i.e. send you a photo of that alien) as well as a witty comment about that alien. 
The three pre-defined chips are:
- Four Arms (a four-armed red alien with super strenght)
- Echo Echo (a small alien who emits an ultrasonic scream and can duplicate himself)
- Heatblast (a fiery alien who can throw fireballs)
If the user enters in an alien that isn't recognized, the Omnitrix will inform them that that alien is currently 
not accessible!

Starter code came from Professor Compton!
