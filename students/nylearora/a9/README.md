Starter code came from Professor Compton. 

As a big fan of Marvel Comics, I wanted to try making a supervillain mask. This is a modified version of 
the Hydra uniform from the Marvel Universe, where the character is wearing a black mask with green 
nightvision googles and a white stripe running on the left side of their face. 

Sliders: 
- eyeBorder: changes the thickness of the eye border and the white stripe
- eyeSize: changes the size of the goggles
- fingerSize: change the thickness of the fingers
